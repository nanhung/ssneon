Abstract {#abstract .unnumbered}
================================

- Neonicotinoids are synthetic insecticides used for for pest control for household pets, landscaping and agriculture. 
- It had been increasingly replacing older insecticides (e.g., organophosphates, methylcarbamates, and pyrethroids) due to their low acute mammalian toxicity [@tomizawa2005neonicotinoid]. 
- The first biomonitoring survey of neonicotinoids in NHANES program was started at the of 2014-2015. Details regarding the analytical method, including quality control materials, calibration standards, reagent blanks, and method accuracy, are described by @baker2019quantification.
- After reanalyze the 2015-2016 NHANES data, neonicotinoids had detection frequencies of 0.3%, 7.6%, 4.4%, 0.04%, 21.5%, and 32.8 % for acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, and N-desmethyl-acetamiprid, respectively (Appendix code).
- The detection of neonicotinoid metabolites (N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and 5-hydroxyimidacloprid) more frequently and at much higher concentrations than the corresponding parent compounds suggests that the metabolites may be suitable biomarkers to assess background exposures [@ospina2019exposure]. 
- Addition, neonicotinoids may convert to their metabolites in the environment causing the exposure to the metabolites themselves may also occur in degradation products. About half (49.1%) of the U.S. general population 3 years of age and older was recently exposed to neonicotinoids.
- Imidacloprid was the most widely used neonicotinoid insecticide in the USA for agricultural purposes during 2015 and 2016.
- The data also suggest metabolites are better biomarkers of background exposure than the compounds themselves.
