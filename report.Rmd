Summary {#summary .unnumbered}
================================

Neonicotinoids (neonics) are synthetic insecticides used for flea control for household pets, residential landscaping, and agriculture uses. It has been increasingly used for replacing older insecticides (e.g., organophosphates, methylcarbamates, and pyrethroids) due to their low acute mammalian toxicity [@tomizawa2005neonicotinoid]. However, recent research has identified the possible health risks of neonics including reproductive toxicology, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, hepatotoxicity/hepatocarcinogenicity, and genetic toxicity [@han2018human; @zhang2022human]. In recent years, neonics and their metabolites have been detected through biomonitoring studies worldwide, including USA [@marfo2015relationship; @baker2019quantification; @chen2020nationwide; @li2020profiles]. Urine sample is the most common used biomarkers of neonics exposure.

The first national biomonitoring survey of neonics was conducted by (CDC) during 2014-2015 and first published at January 2019 (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/SSNEON_I.htm). Details regarding the analytical method, including quality control materials, calibration standards, reagent blanks, and method accuracy, are described by @baker2019quantification. The investigation included four parent neonics of acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid. Two metabolites of N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid had also been selected in NHANES corresponding to their parent compounds of acetamiprid and imidacloprid. It is worthwhile to mention that clothianidin is not only a parent compound, it is also a metabolite from thiamethoxam [@wrobel2022human].

The pesticide uses were briefly collected to best understand the relationship between biomonitoring results and exposure to neonics. The initial analysis was conducted in @ospina2019exposure. The study found that the detection frequencies of imidacloprid, clothianidin, 5-hydroxy imidacloprid, and N-desmethyl-acetamiprid are 4.3%, 7.7%, 19.7%, and 35%, respectively. Both acetamiprid and thiacloprid had relatively low detection rates (<0.5%). The result indicated that the detected rates of metabolites were much higher than the corresponding parent compounds, suggesting that the metabolites may be suitable biomarkers to assess background exposures. In addition to direct intake of the parent compound, neonics may convert to their metabolites in the environment, causing exposure to the metabolites themselves may also occur in degradation products. Overall, about half (49.1%) of the U.S. general population 3 years of age and older was recently exposed to neonics. The data also suggested that metabolites are better biomarkers of background exposure than the compounds themselves.

The pesticide uses were briefly collected and summarized as follows to best understand the relationship between biomonitoring results and potential exposure to neonics. DPRâ€™s Pesticide Use Reporting shows that the highest use of neonics was imidacloprid (523,769, 378,619, and 330,638 pounds in 2019, 2020, and 2021), followed by acetamiprid (63,220.8, 68,377, and 61,068 pounds), and clothianidin (20,197, 24,448, 12,944 pounds) (https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/pur/purmain.htm). According to the Annual Agricultural Pesticide Use data from the United States Geological Survey (https://water.usgs.gov/nawqa/pnsp/usage/maps/), imidacloprid was the most widely used neonicotinoid insecticide in the USA for agricultural purposes, which had higher uses (about 1 million pounds per year) compared to acetamiprid (about 0.1 million pounds per year). It is also detected in wastewater treatment plants in northern California [@north2004tracking]. The use of clothianidin was lower than 0.5 million pounds in recent years (estimated after 2015). Thiacloprid was mainly used in orchards and grapes and therefore had relatively lower uses (< 2,000 pounds per year).

In addition to national survey from CDC, the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcome (ECHO) Program investigated pregnant women across the United States and Puerto Rico and found that neonicotinoid insecticides were highly detected, especially thiamethoxam and N-desmethyl-acetamiprid in more than 90%, among pregnant women and generally more highly detected among Hispanic women [@buckley2022exposure]. The study also found higher concentrations or detection frequencies in later years (from 2017 to 2020) of collection for several neonics (acetamiprid and clothianidin), which have been increasingly used in the U.S. as a replacement for organophosphate pesticides and other pyrethroids. It is worthnoting that neonicotinoid insecticides and their metabolites can pass through the Human Placenta [@zhang2022neonicotinoid].

Since the CDC public released the first neonics survey, this data had been used to conduct the statistical research to understand the associations of neonics with several human health impacts, such as insulin and glucose homeostasis parameters [@vuong2022associations], hematologic parameters [@yang2023associations], pathogenesis of adiposity [@godbole2022exploratory], and sex hormones [@jinxia2021exposure] in US general population, including children, adolescents, and adult. All of these studies found that neonics concentrations had a statistically significant association with health impacts, indicating the concern of chronic adverse effects under the current exposure for the general US population.

Except for the biomonitoring survey, the predicted intake can also be a reference in human exposure assessment. The Expocast program from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides the available exposure predictions of neonics [@ring2018consensus]. The median (geometric mean) exposure rate (mg/kg bodyweight/day) for the general US population were 1.18e-6 (95%ile: 1.11e-3), 5.99e-7 (2.39e-4), 3.52e-7 (3.07e-4), and 1.66e-7 (1.64e-5) in thiacloprid, acetamiprid, clothianidin, and imidacloprid, respectively. These predictions were based on the meta-model using the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models framework with various predictors (e.g., production volume, uses probability in dietary, industrial, and residential), therefore might not reflect the actual exposure effectively. Thus, these predictions can be further improved by incorporate the newly available NHANES urine biomonitoring data with Bayesian inference approach [@stanfield2022bayesian]. Other than the high-throughput approach in exposure prediction mentioned above, a recent research also focuses on applying the traditional low-throughput approach that focus on using the animal model with toxicokinetic data to extrapolate the human exposure and risk evaluation [@yi2023evaluation]. However, in their evaluation, the study didn't quantify the uncertainty and variability, which is a key to the human health risk-assessment of environmental chemicals [@zeise2013addressing]. The data gap existed in in-vivo and toxicokinetic study also provides the challenge in exposure and risk assessment.

In conclusion, neonics pesticides are gained more attention in recent years due to the widely uses from household to commercial applications to replace the traditional active ingredients. The studies related to neonics exposure investigation and toxicity in human also rapidly grow in the last decade to identify the relationship between the exposure and health effects. Although, more research is needed to identify biomarkers of exposure to neonics and to evaluate changes in neonics exposure over time. The available biomonitoring data is a useful resource for toxicokinetic model development and exposure reconstruction for better understanding of neonicotinoid exposure.
