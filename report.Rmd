Abstract {#abstract .unnumbered}
================================

Neonicotinoids (NEOs) are synthetic insecticides used for flea control for household pets, residential landscaping and agriculture uses. It had been increasingly used for replacing older insecticides (e.g., organophosphates, methylcarbamates, and pyrethroids) due to their low acute mammalian toxicity [@tomizawa2005neonicotinoid]. However, recent research had identified the possible health risks of NEOs includes reproductive toxicology, neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, hepatotoxicity/hepatocarcinogenicity, and genetic toxicity [@han2018human; @zhang2022human]. In recent years, NEOs and their metabolites had been detected through biomonitoring studies. @marfo2015relationship identified NEOs metabolites in suspected neonicotinoid pesticide poisoning patients from their urine samples that can be the biomarkers of exposure.

- The first biomonitoring survey of neonicotinoids in NHANES program was started at the of 2014-2015 and first published at January 2019 (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/SSNEON_I.htm). Details regarding the analytical method, including quality control materials, calibration standards, reagent blanks, and method accuracy, are described by @baker2019quantification]. The investigation included four parent NEOs of acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid. Two metabolites of N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid had also been selected in NHANES corresponding to their parent compounds of acetamiprid and imidacloprid. 

- After reanalyze the 2015-2016 NHANES data, neonicotinoids had detection frequencies of 0.3%, 7.6%, 4.4%, 0.04%, 21.5%, and 32.8% for acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, and N-desmethyl-acetamiprid, respectively (Appendix code).
- The detection of neonicotinoid metabolites (N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and 5-hydroxyimidacloprid) more frequently and at much higher concentrations than the corresponding parent compounds suggests that the metabolites may be suitable biomarkers to assess background exposures [@ospina2019exposure]. 
- Addition, neonicotinoids may convert to their metabolites in the environment causing the exposure to the metabolites themselves may also occur in degradation products. About half (49.1%) of the U.S. general population 3 years of age and older was recently exposed to neonicotinoids.
- Imidacloprid was the most widely used neonicotinoid insecticide in the USA for agricultural purposes during 2015 and 2016. It is also detected in wastewater treatment plants in northern California [@north2004tracking].  Addition, the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcome (ECHO) Program observed neonicotinoid insecticides were highly detected (six detected and thiamethoxam and N-desmethyl-acetamiprid in more than 90%) among pregnant women and generally more highly detected among Hispanic women [@buckley2022exposure]. The study also found higher concentrations or detection frequencies in later years (from 2017 to 2020) of collection for several neonicotinoids (acetamiprid and clothianidin), which have been increasingly used in the U.S. as a replacement for organophosphate pesticides and other pyrethroids. It is worthnoting that neonicotinoid insecticides and their metabolites can pass through the Human Placenta [@zhang2022neonicotinoid].
- The data also suggest metabolites are better biomarkers of background exposure than the compounds themselves.
- Since the CDC public released the first neonicotinoids survey, this data had been used to conduct the research to understand the associations of neonicotinoids with insulin and glucose homeostasis parameters [@vuong2022associations], hematologic parameters [@yang2023associations], pathogenesis of adiposity [@godbole2022exploratory], and sex hormones [@jinxia2021exposure] in US general population, including children, adolescents, and adult.
